# BMC tpl\\tplpre language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [tpl](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/DISCO111/The+Pattern+Language+TPL) in Atom.

Originally re-made from the [Sublmime text 3 bundle](https://github.com/triaglesis/BMC_TPL_IDE).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.


## Additional functionality will be added soon in both versions for Sublime Text and Atom.
