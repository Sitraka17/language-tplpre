# BMC tpl or tplpre language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [tpl](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/DISCO111/The+Pattern+Language+TPL) in Atom.

Originally re-made from the [Sublmime text 3 bundle](https://github.com/triaglesis/bmc_tpl).

Build Logic for this package is not included, you can find it in separate [repo](https://github.com/triaglesis/BMC_TPL_IDE)

## Installation:
- Copy 'language-tplpre' to: C:\Users\USER\\.atom\packages\

- Move ".atom-build.yml" to your project root folder.


## Use:
- Set syntax: Ctrl+Shift+L -> type 'tplpre'

- Automation, syntax check, upload pattern, etc:

With module: [BMC_TPL_IDE](https://github.com/triaglesis/BMC_TPL_IDE) you can most development routines automatically.
For Atom command templates will be available in Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) - [build system](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/reference/build_systems.html)


Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

### Additional functionality will be added soon in both versions for Sublime Text and Atom.
